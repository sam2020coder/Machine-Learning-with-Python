# Machine-Learning-with-Python
Data Classification using Python
This is  a historical dataset from previous loan applications. The tasks to do this project are cleaning the data, and applying different classification algorithm on the data. we are expected to use the following algorithms to build our models:  k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:  Jaccard index, F1-score and LogLoass.
